Huffman codg is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input oracters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding charaers. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent oracter gets the laast code.The variable-length codes assigned to input characters are Prefix Codes, means the codes (bit sequences) are assigned in such a way that the code assigned to one character is not the prefix of code assigned to any other character. This is how Huffman Coding makes sure that there is no ambiguity when decoding the generated bitstream. Let us understand prefix codes with a counter example.

This is how Huffman Coding makes sure that there is no ambiguity when decoding the generated bitstream. Let us understand prefix codes with a counter example.
